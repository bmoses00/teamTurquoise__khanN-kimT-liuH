Nahi created the component map which correlates to the sitemap directly.
The component map incorporates the pages and such to lead into the creation of
the sitemap by Taejoon. In accordance with the component map and site map,
Henry was able to visualize the database layout diagram. In this, he utilized
tables to finish up on the layout. We looked at other teams design docs and we
improved ours by learning from it.

Still figuring out on how to incorporate it with the main flask app.

get everything connected
